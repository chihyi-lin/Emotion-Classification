# Session 3: 2022-05-02
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Discuss the implemetation of the both two-class and  multi-class perceptron model 

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Completed the baseline: the implementation of both two-class and multi-class perceptron model

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Improve current implementation and plan more advanced approach 


# Session 2: 2022-04-25
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Complete the implementation of evaluation
* Implement baseline: figure out which features to extract from each emotion, so as to calculate the vectors

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Completed the implementation of evaluation
* Implemented baseline: feature extraction on emotion ‘joy’ done

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Research on perceptron
* Complete the implementation of baseline


# Session 1: 2022-04-11
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Look at data
* Decide on topic
* Prepare work environment: Git & Github

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Looked at data
* Prepared work environment
* Decided on topic and data: Emotion Classification (ISEAR)
* Started implementing evaluation
* Defined classes of the model (still in progress)

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Continue implementing evaluation
* Continue defining classes of the model
