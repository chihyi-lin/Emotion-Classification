# Session 7: 2022-05-30
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Start recording: finalise the presentation scripts and slides by Wednesday (1 June) 
* Video editing
* Upload recording by Sunday (5 June)
* Error analysis and further literature review

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)

* further literature review

# Session 6: 2022-05-23
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Baseline improvement: 1) Run experiment with different settings(epochs, learning rate) - Lin ; 2) implementing results: i.e. macro vs. micro average/accuracy - Lai
* Working on the presentation: 1) Finalize slides 2) Start recording - Lin and Lai
* Discussion on next steps: 1) improve pre-processing and feature extraction with tf-idf - Lin 2) start implementing SVM - Lai 

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Baseline improved
* Slides finalised

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Literature review on progress 
* Questions to discuss and present: 1) It seems F-scores of different learning rates do not differ much. We would like to ask if it is common for the multi-class perceptron model. 2) The research question is whether performance improves combining different feature extractions using different machine learning models. 

# Session 5: 2022-05-16
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Literature review on next-steps
* Discuss which direction we would like to take: more manually (i.e. error anaylsis) or more based on literature (e.g. comparing multi-class perceptron with gradiant descent)
* Baseline improvement
* Working on the presentation slides

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Tentatively decided to further the project on past studies, forming research question(s) based on literature: do better feature extraction approaches improve the performance of two models (multi-class perceptron vs. SVM)?
* Baseline improvement: 1) add bias and learning rate; 2)add average F-score

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Finalize presentation slides
* Run experiment with different settings


# Session 4: 2022-05-9
## Goals for today (fill at the beginning of each work week)
* Combine the scripts of both two-class and multi-class perceptron models
* Combine the evaluator with the multi-class perceptron model
* Check if corpus data is cleaned
* Discuss how the multi-class perceptron model can be optimised 
* Start the preparation of presentation

## Goals achieved (fill at the end of each work week)
* Start preparing the mid-term presentation
* Start reading literature on the topic of emotion classification
* Implemented the class method to clean data
* Trained the multi-class perceptron on training data, tested the perceptron on validation data, and evaluated results with the evaluator

## Plans for next week (fill at the end of each work week)
* Add bias and learning rate of the current model
* Brainstorm on next-steps, i.e. questions that we would like to ask/discuss: 1)what does error analysis refer to? 2)our current ideas of research questions: optimisation of the model with e.g. gradiant descent, SVM, MIRA 
* Further literature review on the topic
